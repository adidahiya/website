### Assignment

> Create a digital, audio-visual, sample based instrument. You can record your own samples, or use existing ones. Once it's done (or almost done), compose a ~20-30 second piece using your instrument and do a video recording of it.

I used few samples I downloaded from [Splice](http://splice.com/) to create a simple drum machine.

[Interact with it here](/projects/code-of-music/simple-drum-machine) and check out the code on GitHub.

Here's my short techno-inspired piece:
