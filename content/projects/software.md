<h3 id="software">Blueprint (2015-present)</h3>

I led the development of [Blueprint](https://blueprintjs.com/), [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/)'s open source UI toolkit and design language. You can view its [GitHub repository here](https://github.com/palantir/blueprint). I helped design its APIs, abstractions, and interactions. I also engaged with the TypeScript and React open source community to continually improve the project.
