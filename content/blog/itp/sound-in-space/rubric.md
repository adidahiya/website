### Rubric for my work in this class

This class is an exploration in sound art for me. When I am listening to a musical performance, often times I find the parts which are surprising or unexpected to be "artistic" or "poetic". So some of the goals of my work in _Sound in Space_ are to create similar musical moments.

The work should have one or more of these elements:

-   it produces a surprising emotional response
-   it leverages utilizes space to emulate a physical experience (falling down, objects moving towards or away from you, being underwater, moving quickly in a vehicle, etc)
-   it is generative and/or infinitely running
-   leverages the specific medium & its affordances appropriately ([see notes on medium specificity & genre](../../content-and-its-discontents/genre))

Anti-goals:

-   narrative storytelling through sound
-   demonstrate mastery of music theory
