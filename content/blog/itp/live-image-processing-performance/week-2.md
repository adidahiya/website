### Beginnings of a video playback system

I reviewed the patches from last week and there were a few Jitter objects which I found really interesting, worth further exploration:

- jit.rota zoom with boundmode 3 (clip)
- jit.ameba
- jit.plur (my computer seems to be too slow to run this at any reasonable frame rate...)
- jit.scanslide
- jit.slide (unbalanced slide feels very psychedelic / hallucinatory)

Here's a screen capture of a few simple elements hooked up with [the videos I collected last week](../week-1):

### Inspiration

I started collecting some inspiration for my video performance, check it out in [this are.na channel](https://www.are.na/adi-dahiya/live-image-processing-performance-rqmvt774zro).

I plan to perform my own electronic music during the performance and connect Max to Ableton. One concept that I've been noodling with is the "abstraction of the music-making process" where I take a video of myself performing the music and use that as the music video.
